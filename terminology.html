                        Anti-Aliasing is a technique to reduce the jagged edges of a image due to low resolution, or misaligned pixels. Anti-Aliasing works by blending or bluring the colors along the edges to create a more smoother look. Often appearing as an option in games
                        due to hardware constraints from computer to computer, Anti-Aliasing helps smooth out the look of edges in gameplay at a significantly lower performance cost then if played at a higher resolution. There are different types of Anti-Aliasing or AA for short
                        with each having different tradeoffs in regards to visual/quality improvement and performance impact.

                    <p class="infotext">
                        A bottleneck is a situation in which a component performance can not keep up with another components performance. An example would be if you have a slow CPU but a fast GPU, the CPU would bottleneck the GPU causing the overall performance of your PC to
                        be lower. Like how having a narrower/wider neck on an actual bottle will impact the overall speed or flow of the water can be poured out.
                        As parts and components are often interconnected and work together having one part slower or one part faster will impact your PC performance. This is why it is important to take a holistic view when building your PC so you don't introduce
                        bottlenecks which can limit the performance of your system.

                        DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is technology devolped by Nvidia that upscales lower resoultion images into higher resolution images without as much of the performance cost of rendering it's higher resolution counterpart. This improves
                        overall game performance while also improving the graphics fidelity of the game. This technology is exclusive to Nvidia GPU's. Though AMD has a counterpart called FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) which is open-source and works on both
                        Nvidia GPUs and AMD GPUs the technology as of 2023, both in graphics and peformance, does not perform as well as NVIDIA's DLSS though they are making strides.

                        Drivers are bascially software that allows your hardware to communicate to you're OS (Operating System) like windows and also ensure compatibility with it.
                        Drivers are usually built in to the hardware themselves, however due to optimizations, bug fixing, security patches, or enabling new features companies will release new driver updates.
                        Which is why when something isn't working correctly you would most likely hear the phrase, "Have you tried updating your drivers yet?" Well that and "Have you tried turning it off and on?".
                        Drivers can be found on the company website, and should be only be downloaded from said company website.
                        As there are malicious actors out there who may spread malicious drivers that may harm your pc or even you.

                        FPS or Frames Per Second in the context of gaming is the number of individual image Frames that your PC can generate Per Second.
                        FPS as a concept though encompasses both games and visual media in general with movies being recorded at 24FPS or a youtube video running at 60FPS (24 frames and 60 frames per second of a video respectively).
                        FPS in the context of the former however is also used as a measurement to how well your PC perform. With higher FPS reprsenting better performance low FPS representing poor performance and so on and so forth.
                        Mantaining a high FPS in games results in a smoother and overall better gaming experience however there is an upper limit to these improvements which are usually constrained by a monitor's refresh rate.

                    <p class="infotext">
                        Refresh rate is the number times your monitor can refresh or update an image per second. It is measured in Hz(Herts), so a 60Hz monitor can refresh up to 60 times per second.
                        You can probably see the parallel between FPS and refresh rate because there is in fact a relationship between them. If you exceed your monitors refresh rate of say 60Hz during
                        a game where you're cranking say 70-80 FPS you will not see a noticebale improvement to the overall smoothness or experience, because your 60hz monitor can only display 60 frames per second.
                        Though having extra frames never hurt, as it is a sign that you're PC is performing well, having that extra buffer in performance can also improve your experience as drop in frames, during taxing scenes or
                        environments are less noticeble, as dropping 10fps when you're on an average 80fps will still exceed the threshold of your 60hz monitor's refresh rate. The most common refresh rate of a monitor is 60hz, however
                        144hz has becoming more popular and even 240hz/360hz monitor are available on the market (Though at that point you are getting diminishing returns).

                    <p class="infotext">
                        Overclocking is the process in which you increase the clock speed, cycles of instructions per second, of your CPU, GPU, and/or RAM beyond the factory or default specifications to get more performance out of your components.
                        As components are often designed for stability in mind, there is usually some wiggle room to increase the clock speeds as manufactures usually have a buffer to maintain stability. However to increase your clock speed you may also need
                        to increase your voltage to your components as higher clock speed can result in higher power draw. This higher power draw in turn produces more heat so having sufficient cooling for your component is a must when overclocking. However
                        be warned as overclocking can reduce the longevity of your components(if they are not sufficiently cooled due to the heat) and can cause instability to your PC.
